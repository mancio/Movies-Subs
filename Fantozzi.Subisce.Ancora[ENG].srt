Fantozzi Still Suffer

00: 01: 42,923 -> 00: 01: 44,832
<i> After the alternation
of wise governments ... </i>

3
00: 01: 45,033 -> 00: 01: 49,940
<i> finally the Italian people
reached a high degree of maturity. </i>

4
00: 01: 50,025 -> 00: 01: 54,143
<i> Workers, workers and employees,
they finally understood ... </i>

5
00: 01: 54,170 -> 00: 01: 57,580
<i> that productivity is the basis
of social welfare ... </i>

6
00: 01: 57.674 -> 00: 02: 00.615
<i> and the only way
to get out of the crisis. </i>

I can't live without my forms!

11
00: 02: 15,378 -> 00: 02: 18,241
Let's help our country!

Let's go up the stairs,
We save time!

13
00: 02: 30,710 -> 00: 02: 35,595
<i> The two great plagues,
absenteeism and the second job ... </i>

14
00: 02: 36,031 -> 00: 02: 39,447
<i> that so much damage caused
to the Italian economy ... </i>

15
00: 02: 39,786 -> 00: 02: 43,347
<i> can finally be considered
defeated and eradicated. </i>

16
00: 02: 43,773 -> 00: 02: 48,294
<i> Come on, let's go to work.
Let's go to work. </i>

- By mails.

19

Could you take me?
This morning I came without the car.

20
00: 02: 57,217 -> 00: 02: 59,317
- Wasn't it in the Civil Registry?
- Yes, but I have three jobs.

21
00: 02: 59,318 -> 00: 03: 00,818
Three?

22
00: 03: 05,592 -> 00: 03: 07,092
Hi Cabrini!

23
00: 03: 24,695 -> 00: 03: 27,897

To the fifth.

00: 12: 18,120 -> 00: 12: 19,909
Welcome,
Miss Silvani.

63
00: 12: 20,878 -> 00: 12: 24,011
How was it
your day in the "solarium"?

64
00: 12: 24,048 -> 00: 12: 26,115
Don't even remind me, Fantozzi!
A shit day

65
00: 12: 26,116 -> 00: 12: 27,816
With the sun coming and going.

66
00: 12: 29,232 -> 00: 12: 31,670
- I'm sorry.
- Lucky you, Fantozzi ...

67
00: 12: 31,671 -> 00: 12: 35,567
... who stayed here, quiet.
- Well more or less.

68
00: 12: 37,828 -> 00: 12: 41,151
Miss.
Miss Silvani ...

69
00: 12: 42,664 -> 00: 12: 44,464
I want to tell you a year ago ...

70
00: 12: 44,589 -> 00: 12: 46,635
maybe you have not noticed,
but I...

71
00: 12: 46,869 -> 00: 12: 50,843
All this ... I do it for you.
Just for you.

72
00: 12: 59,077 -> 00: 13: 03,336
Then he will ...
tomorrow too ...

73
00: 13: 03,537 -> 00: 13: 05,237
Fantozzino?

74
00: 13: 07,529 -> 00:13: 12,819
Yes, I will tomorrow too.
I will, I will.

75
00: 13: 13,172 -> 00: 13: 14,942
And now leave, Fantozzi,
It smells like sweat!

76
00: 13: 15,181 -> 00: 13: 18,193
- Get out, let's go! Go away!
- That awful!

77
00: 13: 18,252 -> 00: 13: 21,717
- Come on, go wash! Stinks!
- Come on, go wash yourself, stinky!

78
00: 13: 22,418 -> 00: 13: 23,918
How can you sweat so much?

79
00: 13: 24,422 -> 00: 13: 26,760
It is low spider,
It has a plebeian metabolism.

80
00: 13: 26,861 -> 00: 13: 28,664
- It's a pig!
- Use the bidet too!

81
00: 13: 28,865 -> 00: 13: 30,395
It smells from here!

82
00: 13: 30,996 -> 00: 13: 32,496
Attention!

83
00: 13: 38,213 -> 00: 13: 40,611
- Who is missing here?
- Fantozzi!

84
00: 13: 42,005 -> 00: 13: 43,676
Hello, Fantozzi house.
Who speaks?

85
00: 13: 45,154 -> 00: 13: 46,654
What's up, Ugo?

86
00: 13: 47,212 -> 00: 13: 48,712
What have they done to you?

87
00: 13: 48,726 -> 00: 13: 52,074
Nothing Pina, don't worry.
I just have to do some overtime.

88
00: 13: 52,449 -> 00: 13: 55,158
Ok then go
to pick up MariÃ¡ngela at work.

89
00: 13: 55,246 -> 00: 13: 56,746
Yes, I will go later.

90
00: 13: 57,576 -> 00: 14: 00,528
Not now, Pina.
I can't move now.

91
00: 14: 03,400 -> 00: 14: 07,219
I AM AN ABSENT

93
00: 14: 33,273 -> 00: 14: 34,773
Hello Dad.

94
00: 14: 36,458 -> 00: 14: 38,368
Hello Hello.

95
00: 14: 39,489 -> 00: 14: 40,989
Good Morning.

96
00: 14: 41,273 -> 00: 14: 42,773
Sorry.

97
00: 14: 43,460 -> 00: 14: 45,147
- You want?
- I've come to look for ...

98
00: 14: 45,148 -> 00: 14: 47,448
You too?
It will be possible, you too!

99
00: 14: 47,847 -> 00: 14: 50,606
She is not for sale! It's the
Saleswoman, it's not a chimpanzee!

100
00: 14: 50,718 -> 00: 14: 53,398
What are you talking about? Is he crazy?
That is my bambina!

101
00: 14: 53,399 -> 00: 14: 55,780
It's not a baboon,
She is the seller!

102
00: 14: 55,977 -> 00: 14: 58,904
This is my babui ...
bambina! My daughter!

103
00: 15: 00,699 -> 00: 15: 02,442
Mariangela, go change yourself,
It is 7 o'clock.

104
00: 15: 03,379 -> 00: 15: 07,454
Excuse me, it's not a reproach,
but he has treated my daughter ...

105
00: 15: 07,455 -> 00: 15: 09,891
as if it were a chimpanzee,
I do not know if...

106
00: 15: 11,395 -> 00: 15: 12,895
It's okey, see you soon.

107
00: 15: 13,445 -> 00: 15: 16,403
Come Mariangela, honey.
Dad will get you out of here.

108
00: 15: 17,104 -> 00: 15: 18,904
I already made a request
for a post in Post Office.

109
00: 15: 19,218 -> 00: 15: 22,122
- Because this is not a place for you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

110
00: 15: 22,490 -> 00: 15: 24,765
Is he getting live?
Take yours.

111
00: 15: 26,112 -> 00: 15: 30,903
Because ... I get confused ...
they look alike, then ...

112
00: 15: 31,099 -> 00: 15: 32,599
Well, take ...

113
00: 15: 33,104 -> 00: 15: 36,912
Sorry.
You want this ...

114
00: 15: 38,996 -> 00: 15: 41,813
Dad was kidding!
We're going home.

115
00: 15: 45,996 -> 00: 15: 48,065
- Open Pina!
- I'm going!

116
00: 15: 48,896 -> 00: 15: 50,396
Pina, I forgot the keys.

117
00: 15: 50,654 -> 00: 15: 52,831
- Have you already served the spaghetti with tuna?
- No, Ugo ...

118
00: 15: 53,296 -> 00: 15: 54,796
I've been all day
thinking about them

119
00: 15: 54,837 -> 00: 15: 58,540
Wait Ugo, wait.
Don't you remember what day it is today?

120
00: 16: 00,388 -> 00: 16: 01,888
What day is it?

121
00: 16: 05,678 -> 00: 16: 08,501
Do not...!
Do not...!

122
00: 16: 09,805 -> 00: 16: 11,922
- Everyone has come.
- Everybody?

123
00: 16: 13,878 -> 00: 16: 17,032
It's okay!
Let's not make a drama.

124
00: 16: 17,133 -> 00: 16: 18,633
- Where is Mariangela?
- Here.

125
00: 16: 19,453 -> 00: 16: 22,422
Pay attention. Lock yourself
in the bathroom and stay safe.

126
00: 16: 22,799 -> 00: 16: 24,654
And wait for the signal to exit.

127
00: 16: 24,655 -> 00: 16: 27,038
- The song of the owl?
- No Pina, the song of the owl!

128
00: 16: 27,256 -> 00: 16: 29,745
- Yes, all right, the song of the owl.
- Well, there I go.

129
00: 16: 30,625 -> 00: 16: 33,504
- Ugo, be careful!
- Pina, don't overdo it!

130
00: 16: 33,505 -> 00: 16: 35,005
I had worse things in my life.

131
00: 16: 35,703 -> 00: 16: 39,792
- Mariangela, give dad a kiss.
- Ah ... ah ... wait!

132
00: 16: 39,865 -> 00: 16: 42,344
I am not prepared for a kiss.

133
00: 16: 42,874 -> 00: 16: 44,374
- Go!
- Come on.

134
00: 16: 45,110 -> 00: 16: 46,645
The owl, remember, the owl!

135
00: 16: 56,855 -> 00: 17: 00,391
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

136
00: 17: 02,632 -> 00: 17: 07,817
<i> It was the terrifying
bimonthly community meeting ... </i>

137
00: 17: 08,350 -> 00: 17: 13,164
<i> that was done in shifts in
House of the various tenants. </i>

138
00: 17: 13,711 -> 00: 17: 16,275
This time we name it
to you President.

139
00: 17: 16,276 -> 00: 17: 18,102
- To me?
- Yes, accountant.

140
00: 17: 18,103 -> 00: 17: 20,440
So,
I declare the session open!

141
00: 17: 23,342 -> 00: 17: 24,842
Never close the elevator!

142
00: 17: 30,400 -> 00: 17: 33,779
- You are a delinquent!
- And you are a cuckold!

143
00: 17: 34,280 -> 00: 17: 35,379
He still owes three
dues!

144
00: 17: 35,380 -> 00: 17: 39,887
Here you have them:
one, two ... and three!

145
00: 17: 40,288 -> 00: 17: 43,718
Four five...
And six! Taking!

146
00: 17: 43,819 -> 00: 17: 44,929
And seven!

147
00: 17: 44,930 -> 00: 17: 47,215
Go down to check
the gatekeeper's checkpoint!

148
00: 17: 47,416 -> 00: 17: 50,016
You are the administrator,
go, go!

149
00: 17: 51,435 -> 00: 17: 52,390
- It is gone.

150
00: 17: 52,391 -> 00: 17: 55,747
- And you turn down the volume of your TV.
- And you educate your son!

151
00: 17: 55,803 -> 00: 17: 57,303
The session is over!

152
00: 17: 58.031 -> 00: 17: 59.574
- Until next time.
- Goodnight.

153
00: 18: 00,258 -> 00: 18: 02,300
<i> At the beginning of the following summer ... </i>

154
00: 18: 02,701 -> 00: 18: 05,304
<i> a fact occurred
absolutely outstanding. </i>

155
00: 18: 05,805 -> 00: 18: 11,051
<i> So much that the employees, for once,
renounced absenteeism ... </i>

156
00: 18: 11,052 -> 00: 18: 14,050
<i> and they stayed
in the office working. </i>

157
00: 18: 14,051 -> 00: 18: 16,705
- Dancing days!
- Bravo!

158
00: 18: 20,319 -> 00: 18: 24,031
- These are easy questions!
- They are not easy. They are not easy.

159
00: 18: 24,135 -> 00: 18: 26,668
"Gentlemen, the prize
this week, here it is! "

160
00: 18: 26,769 -> 00: 18: 29,300
It is a "Camper"!

161
00: 18: 31,162 -> 00: 18: 35,021
- What an ass! What a cheeky ass!
- Well, you don't have to be vulgar!

162
00: 18: 36,048 -> 00: 18: 38,464
Sorry,
Will she go alone on vacation?

163
00: 18: 40,412 -> 00: 18: 43,214
Do you think I have problems?

164
00: 18: 43,535 -> 00: 18: 45,897
Wonderful lady.
Do you want to greet someone?

165
00: 18: 45,898 -> 00: 18: 51,202
I want to greet my colleagues that
They will surely be watching me.

166
00: 18: 52,551 -> 00: 18: 55,745
And that encouraged me
to participate in this game.

167
00: 18: 56,960 -> 00: 18: 59,311
- Lobbiam is coming!
- Get out, let's go!

168
00: 19: 05,670 -> 00: 19: 07,902
- Good Morning.
- Good morning, excellence.

169
00: 19: 07,985 -> 00: 19: 14,197
<i> Miss Silvani's prize
unleashed a coordinating impulse ... </i>

170
00: 19: 14,198 -> 00: 19: 20,073
<i> of Accountant Filini, who organized
immediately a caravan holiday, </i>

171
00: 19: 20,074 -> 00: 19: 22,674
<i> each with his own trailer. </i>

172
00: 19: 23,072 -> 00: 19: 29,930
<i> Fantozzi and Filini went to remove them
to the tragic maze of the car park, </i>

173
00: 19: 30,562 -> 00: 19: 34,893
<i> and with the chilling coincidence,
both the same day ... </i>

174
00: 19: 34,894 -> 00: 19: 38,596
<i> at the same time
and the same model. </i>

175
00: 19: 45,077 -> 00: 19: 46,874
<i> So, in the morning
of game day </i>

176
00: 19: 47,177 -> 00: 19: 52,350
<i> in front of the gate of Silvani's house,
They presented themselves in order ...

177
00: 19: 52,791 -> 00: 19: 54,291

178
00: 19: 54,406 -> 00: 19: 56,797
<i> partners to save

179

<i> but preserving each

180
00: 20: 01,491 -> 00: 20: 04,134
- Miss!
- Miss Silvani, congratulations!

181
00: 20: 04,482 -> 00: 20: 08,395
<i> Calboni, what did you bring
shamelessly as a camper ... </i>

182
00: 20: 08,666 -> 00: 20: 11,619
<i> an old ambulance of
the Charitable Society, </i>

183
00: 20: 11,621 -> 00: 20: 15,858
<i> who had rented him to a
unscrupulous stretcher friend. </i>

184
00: 20: 16,259 -> 00: 20: 21,075
<i> And as Noble Bourbon, the companion
I had chosen for the trip ... </i>

185
00: 20: 21,376 -> 00: 20: 25,583
<i> a famous Bari whore, called
ironically "The Countess", </i>

186
00: 20: 25,784 -> 00: 20: 28,900
<i> for his manners
particularly aristocratic. </i>

187
00: 20: 29,469 -> 00: 20: 35,850
<i> Filini came later, who solved the problem
with an armored car model "El Alamein" ... </i>

188
00: 20: 36,651 -> 00: 20: 39,917
<i> World War II relic. </i>

189
00: 20: 42,057 -> 00: 20: 43,557
I'm here!

190
00: 20: 46,372 -> 00: 20: 49,661
- Wonderful!
- Good morning, we are all!

191
00: 20: 49,670 -> 00: 20: 52,054
- Ready to go?
- Only Fantozzi is missing!

192
00: 20: 52,292 -> 00: 20: 54,329
Damn, as always!

193
00: 20: 54,691 -> 00: 20: 57,408
- No, no, there it is!
- It is over there!

194
00: 20: 57,470 -> 00: 21: 01,680
- Come on, accountant! Come on!
- That makes? Come on!

195
00: 21: 01,977 -> 00: 21: 03,736
They call us, Ugo. Come on.

196
00: 21: 04,259 -> 00: 21: 05,759
Yes...

197
00: 21: 06,032 -> 00: 21: 10,750
Do we also carry the ...?
As you like. Come on.

198
00: 21: 21,942 -> 00: 21: 24,813
"Eye and evil eye,
parsley and fennel. "

199
00: 21: 28,516 -> 00: 21: 30,580
"Parsley and fennel".

200
00: 21: 30,835 -> 00: 21: 34,394
Well, we are all there!
Go ahead, start the engines!

201
00: 21: 34,495 -> 00: 21: 36,367
All behind me!
Come on!

202
00: 21: 38,038 -> 00: 21: 39,538
Where are you going?

203
00: 21: 40,071 -> 00: 21: 42,369
How where am I going?
I'm going to say hello, right?

204
00: 21: 50,629 -> 00: 21: 53,494
Good morning, Miss Silvani.
I come to greet you, before leaving,

205
00: 21: 53,732 -> 00: 21: 56,386
and take the opportunity to deliver
of this humble gift.

206
00: 21: 56,587 -> 00: 21: 59,287
It's a San Cristobal with magnet
to put on the board.

207
00: 21: 59,288 -> 00: 22: 01,660
He is the Patron of the "Camperistas".

208
00: 22: 05,000 -> 00: 22: 06,873
Excuse me, but no ...
Won't you open it?

209
00: 22: 07,616 -> 00: 22: 11,255
Ugo, I want to remind you
I'm here, your wife!

210
00: 22: 12,867 -> 00: 22: 14,739
Poor dear! He wanted to come ...

211
00: 22: 14,759 -> 00: 22: 17,179
Because she's jealous of us.

212
00: 22: 18,312 -> 00: 22: 20,477
- But what does it say?
- She's jealous of you ...

213
00: 22: 20,573 -> 00: 22: 24,375
... because you already know that we ...
- With you?

214
00: 22: 24,785 -> 00: 22: 27,200
Excuse me, but it's like
Be jealous of a toad!

215
00: 22: 30,151 -> 00: 22: 31,651
How, who has spoken?

216
00: 22: 31,825 -> 00: 22: 34,860
When we are in line
Let everyone honk their horn!

217
00: 22: 34,861 -> 00: 22: 36,361
Ahead!

218
00: 22: 40,572 -> 00: 22: 42,072
<i> Silvani Horn ... </i>

219
00: 22: 42,397 -> 00: 22: 43,897
<i> Mermaid of Calboni ... </i>

220
00: 22: 43,916 -> 00: 22: 45,416
<i> Colzi and Mughini's horn ... </i>

221
00: 22: 46,135 -> 00: 22: 47,635
<i> Fantozzi Horn ... </i>

222
00: 22: 48,349 -> 00: 22: 50,068
<i> And Filini's horn ...! </i>

223
00: 23: 09,272 -> 00: 23: 11,029
Sound the horn, let him know!

224
00: 23: 11,102 -> 00: 23: 14,134
Are you crazy, Pina? If you answer us
We're screwed

225
00: 23: 14,635 -> 00: 23: 16,930
I may not respond. Does not respond.

226
00: 23: 17,141 -> 00: 23: 19,146
As soon as I can, I will go to the queue.

227
00: 24: 07,901 -> 00: 24: 11,045
<i> After that painful incident
Silvani came forward, </i>

228
00: 24: 11,546 -> 00: 24: 13,125
<i> to avoid more problems. </i>

229
00: 24: 22,818 -> 00: 24: 24,318
What happened?

230
00: 24: 25,852 -> 00: 24: 29,177
He must have tipped a truck
of subscription.

231
00: 24: 31,502 -> 00: 24: 32,670
He needs something?

232
00: 24: 32,671 -> 00: 24: 34,050
ANYWHERE

233
00: 24: 34,051 -> 00: 24: 37,528
Do you want me to take it?
Come on come on up!

2. 3. 4
00: 24: 38,029 -> 00: 24: 39,529
We leave!

235
00: 24: 45,623 -> 00: 24: 48,085
- What are you doing, is she crazy?
- Why?

236
00: 24: 48,768 -> 00: 24: 51,202
How why?
Haven't you seen what went on board?

237
00: 24: 52,462 -> 00: 24: 54,265
I mean,
Such a young girl.

238
00: 24: 55,363 -> 00: 24: 59,588
A young woman like her,
letting up a former convict.

239
00: 25: 01,138 -> 00: 25: 04,781
I already asked you, Ugo, no
worry so much about "that one".

240
00: 25: 04,870 -> 00: 25: 07,873
- At least in my presence.
- Well, look that I ...

241
00: 25: 08,289 -> 00: 25: 11,711
Anyway I don't think that
That young man looks like a former convict.

242
00: 25: 11,712 -> 00: 25: 14,166
No, huh?
Then what?

243
00: 25: 16,164 -> 00: 25: 19,120
I would say ... a nice guy
and poetic globetrotter.

244
00: 25: 22,254 -> 00: 25: 27,213
Here Franco has told me that he will take us
to a wonderful place that only he knows!

245
00: 25: 27,214 -> 00: 25: 29,034
And where nobody ever goes!

246
00: 25: 53,825 -> 00: 25: 55,567
It has its charm.

247
00: 26: 01,369 -> 00: 26: 02,707
Nice, right?

248
00: 26: 02,708 -> 00: 26: 06,500
It is wonderful!
I love the wild nature.

249
00: 26: 07,398 -> 00: 26: 11,178
And we owe this paradise to Franchino,
That made us find it!

250
00: 26: 11,503 -> 00: 26: 13,270
- Franchino!
- Already called "Franchino"?

251
00: 26: 13,271 -> 00: 26: 13,871
Franchino!

252
00: 26: 13,872 -> 00: 26: 15,372
- Why not?
- Franchino, come!

253
00: 26: 16,053 -> 00: 26: 20,312
Come! That is Franchino,
I present to all my friends.

254
00: 26: 22,713 -> 00: 26: 24,213
You feel bad?

255
00: 26: 28,262 -> 00: 26: 30,988
- Will Franchino stay with us?
- Clear!

256
00: 26: 31,412 -> 00: 26: 32,912
He has his sleeping bag.

257
00: 26: 49,878 -> 00: 26: 53,012
Super idea!
Great barbecue of fish!

258
00: 26: 55,878 -> 00: 26: 58,005
Tonight
They will be all my guests.

259
00: 26: 58,106 -> 00: 27: 01,936
The men will take care of the fish.
We girls will cook!

260
00: 27: 02,413 -> 00: 27: 05,529
Very good, Miss Silvani!
Excellent idea, I will organize everything!

261
00: 27: 05,751 -> 00: 27: 08,428
The accountant Fantozzi and I
We will take care of fishing.

262
00: 27: 08,429 -> 00: 27: 11,134
- We will go for the firewood!
- There is a beautiful forest!

263
00: 27: 13,553 -> 00: 27: 17,033
Go for your fishing rod!
I will call Calboni!

264
00: 27: 17,423 -> 00: 27: 18,923
Quick!

265
00: 27: 20,175 -> 00: 27: 22,267
Accountant Calboni!
Accountant Calboni!

266
00: 27: 22,268 -> 00: 27: 24,470
- What happens?
- We will go fishing.

267
00: 27: 25,155 -> 00: 27: 27,022
- What fishing?
- Here, to the pier.

268
00: 27: 27,923 -> 00: 27: 29,208
Do you have a cane?

269
00: 27: 29,209 -> 00: 27: 31,244
If I have cane?
I have a very long one!

270
00: 27: 31,262 -> 00: 27: 34,915
And I was about to use it.
Moreover, if they see the red light turning ...

271
00: 27: 34,916 -> 00: 27: 36,755
It means I'm immersed.

272
00: 27: 37,016 -> 00: 27: 39,789
- Nor bother me
- Sorry.

273
00: 27: 39,790 -> 00: 27: 41,490
- Is nothing.
- My apologies.

274
00: 27: 42,011 -> 00: 27: 45,440
Accountant Fantozzi, what does it do?
Come on, move!

275
00: 27: 46,592 -> 00: 27: 50,466
- It's just opened.
- Come on, if it's nothing. Walking

276
00: 27: 52,652 -> 00: 27: 53,914
- One...
- One!

277
00: 27: 53,915 -> 00: 27: 54,941
- Two...
- Two!

278
00: 27: 54,942 -> 00: 27: 55,781
- Three...
- Three!

279
00: 27: 55,782 -> 00: 27: 57,282
- Pull!
- Pull!

280
00: 28: 00,678 -> 00: 28: 02,757
Accountant Fantozzi,
what have you done?

281
00: 28: 06,636 -> 00: 28: 08,136
It has stung!

282
00: 28: 11,104 -> 00: 28: 14,781
- Mine too!
- Pull! Pull!

283
00: 28: 25,426 -> 00: 28: 27,494
How is the miraculous fishing going?

284
00: 28: 28,592 -> 00: 28: 32,674
Well, well, we already caught eight,
all of the same species!

285
00: 28: 32,676 -> 00: 28: 34,911
- Good fat!
- Nine!

286
00: 28: 37,601 -> 00: 28: 40,398
- My God, how disgusting!
- Ugo!

287
00: 28: 40,399 -> 00: 28: 41,966
They are sewer rats!

288
00: 28: 42,267 -> 00: 28: 45,536
Hey accountant,
I had a suspicion.

289
00: 28: 46,013 -> 00: 28: 49,489
You are the same old pig!
Go fishing offshore!

290
00: 28: 49,529 -> 00: 28: 51,490
Clear!
Take my boat, right?

291
00: 28: 52,974 -> 00: 28: 56,570
Hey, let's pull ...
throw those rats ...

292
00: 28: 56,768 -> 00: 28: 58,111
But what rats or rats?

293
00: 28: 58,112 -> 00: 29: 00,722
Please accountant Fantozzi,
don't start you too!

294
00: 29: 00,916 -> 00: 29: 03,425
There is the dog fish,
The catfish and the ratfish!

295
00: 29: 03,560 -> 00: 29: 06,025
You may like it or not,
I don't discuss that ...

296
00: 29: 06,149 -> 00: 29: 09,528
anyway to me, the barbecue
of rat fish, it drives me crazy.

297
00: 29: 09,598 -> 00: 29: 13,136
Also if you ask,
Let us throw this grace of God into the sea.

298
00: 29: 14,604 -> 00: 29: 16,315
Ready! Happy!

299
00: 29: 17,243 -> 00: 29: 23,194
Accountant, come quickly!
This could get a bit dangerous.

300
00: 29: 23,259 -> 00: 29: 25,686
I am coming right away,
I will set the burglar alarm!

301
00: 29: 32,844 -> 00: 29: 36,528
- At least I saved the engine.
- Yes, I see. Well done!

302
00: 29: 36,958 -> 00: 29: 40,864
I'm afraid it got wet
and water came in.

303
00: 29: 41,365 -> 00: 29: 43,567
- Could you turn it on?
- Yes, we tried it. It is done.

304
00: 29: 47,646 -> 00: 29: 51,350
The button! The button!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

305
00: 29: 51,551 -> 00: 29: 53,958
- Yes, I'll turn it off. I'm going.
- Quick.

306
00: 29: 57,391 -> 00: 30: 00,817
- What was it for ...
- What's going on?

307
00: 30: 01,397 -> 00: 30: 03,816
There must be a whale
Decaying around here.

308
00: 30: 04,696 -> 00: 30: 06,196
Where is the ba ...?

309
00: 30: 08,804 -> 00: 30: 11,525
Seven?
By just one hit?

310
00: 30: 12,047 -> 00: 30: 13,714
At least
clean the octopus.

311
00: 30: 18,154 -> 00: 30: 20,615
Fish and octopus
Without any fantasy.

312
00: 30: 23,416 -> 00: 30: 27,513
Wait. That which is alive,
Who is going to kill him?

313
00: 30: 27,614 -> 00: 30: 29,374
- You.
- I?

314
00: 30: 30,921 -> 00: 30: 32,425
I? It's okay.

315
00: 30: 35,791 -> 00: 30: 38,394
Moron!
You've got caught by that ...

316
00: 30: 40,471 -> 00: 30: 43,783
For that ...
For that idiot.

317
00: 30: 45,377 -> 00: 30: 47,644
Live!
Let's go up!

318
00: 30: 47,957 -> 00: 30: 49,226
No baby?

319
00: 30: 49,227 -> 00: 30: 52,576
If it was for those two,
we would have dined dead rats ...

320
00: 30: 53,677 -> 00: 30: 55,600
same as during
the siege of Stalingrad.

321
00: 30: 56,522 -> 00: 30: 59,173
- A glass for both? Ms?
- I do not drink.

322
00: 30: 59,280 -> 00: 31: 03,004
But, fortunately, he took care
of fish our Franchino.

323
00: 31: 06,917 -> 00: 31: 10,517
Then I propose a "hurray"
by our friend Franchino!

324
00: 31: 10,518 -> 00: 31: 13,544
Hip, hip, hip, hooray!
Hurrah!

325
00: 31: 13,545 -> 00: 31: 15,645
HISTORY OF
PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

326
00: 31: 17,097 -> 00: 31: 20,379
And to conclude an evening with dignity
how is it left ...

327
00: 31: 20,380 -> 00: 31: 23,991
Do as in Filicudo.
The bathroom all naked!

328
00: 31: 24,845 -> 00: 31: 27,247
Wonderful!
Who is coming?

329
00: 31: 27,677 -> 00: 31: 30,630
If you do, me too.
I also! Naked!

330
00: 31: 32,567 -> 00: 31: 34,425
- Pina!
- But yes...

331
00: 31: 34,465 -> 00: 31: 38,995
But ... sorry ...
you are my wife...

332
00: 31: 39,001 -> 00: 31: 41,202
The wife of a bourgeois
Shit like you.

333
00: 31: 46,514 -> 00: 31: 48,014
Wait.

334
00: 31: 49,274 -> 00: 31: 52,273
How I know...? How do you dare?
Sorry...

335
00: 31: 52,274 -> 00: 31: 54,118
Can you bathe naked
and she doesn't?

336
00: 31: 56,520 -> 00: 31: 59,639
Itâs completely different,
because she is my wife ...

337
00: 31: 59,640 -> 00: 32: 03,880
Do not! Because with her, I have a guy
of relationship, that I know how it is handled.

338
00: 32: 04,414 -> 00: 32: 07,654
But what will you know?
You don't even know what world you live in.

339
00: 32: 07,701 -> 00: 32: 09,193
- And do you know why?
- Do not.

340
00: 32: 09,194 -> 00: 32: 10,694
You lack culture.

341
00: 32: 10,880 -> 00: 32: 14,872
No, look Franchino,
I have a diploma.

342
00: 32: 15,351 -> 00: 32: 17,502
- So you are cult?
- I am an accountant.

343
00: 32: 19,333 -> 00: 32: 22,715
- Then let's see.
- What ... what does it do?

344
00: 32: 23,509 -> 00: 32: 27,098
- All right...
- OMG...

3. 4. 5
00: 32: 27,857 -> 00: 32: 30,523
- Literary culture ...?
- Yes.

346
00: 32: 31,209 -> 00: 32: 34,407
Scientist? Or gossip?

347
00: 32: 34,508 -> 00: 32: 38,411
Are they three envelopes?
Should I choose between those three?

348
00: 32: 39,112 -> 00: 32: 40,612
Gossip...

349
00: 32: 42,546 -> 00: 32: 44,834
There is a toilet, here.
It's okay.

350
00: 32: 45,408 -> 00: 32: 46,908
What is the prostate?

351
00: 32: 48,027 -> 00: 32: 54,005
Yes, let's see, the prostate is easy.
It is said of the woman who "prostrates" ...

352
00: 32: 58,179 -> 00: 33: 02,000
But it works!
It's his armpit, anyway ...

353
00: 33: 03,246 -> 00: 33: 07,256
You see, it said that ...
it's a position ...

354
00: 33: 08,582 -> 00: 33: 10,860
a woman...
in state of...

355
00: 33: 11,752 -> 00: 33: 17,677
No, I remember! I already remember it!
It is a dessert. My mother also prepared it.

356
00: 33: 17,778 -> 00: 33: 22,752
It is the "prostate". The "prostate" of
peaches, pears ...

357
00: 33: 24,319 -> 00: 33: 27,761
Already! He is the Roman emperor.
The Byzantine heresiarch

358
00: 33: 27,962 -> 00: 33: 29,562
Giuliano, the "apostate" ...

359
00: 33: 30,985 -> 00: 33: 32,485
And the "kibbutz"?

360
00: 33: 33,693 -> 00: 33: 35,612
It is easy!
It is called "kibbutz" ...

361
00: 33: 35,813 -> 00: 33: 39,990
It is a typical dialectal expression
from Alberobello ...

362
00: 33: 40,091 -> 00: 33: 42,505
what the peasants use
when they knock on the door ...

363
00: 33: 42,706 -> 00: 33: 44,506
With violence and arrogance.

364
00: 33: 44,607 -> 00: 33: 46,909
Then the peasants answer:

365
00: 33: 46,910 -> 00: 33: 49,288
"Who butzca?" ...
in the local dialect.

366
00: 33: 51,734 -> 00: 33: 53,909
Have you understood now
what kind of shit are you

367
00: 33: 59,664 -> 00: 34: 03,450
Ugo, I'll go to bathe naked.

368
00: 34: 06,025 -> 00: 34: 10,680
<i> Fantozzi spent the worst
ten minutes of his life. </i>

369
00: 34: 11,228 -> 00: 34: 16,110
<i> Then, suddenly, as usually happens
who is too unhappy ... </i>

370
00: 34: 16,411 -> 00: 34: 19,949
<i> the situation turned in his favor. </i>

371
00: 34: 19,986 -> 00: 34: 22,939
You and I are in love
from the same man, isn't it?

372
00: 34: 23,164 -> 00: 34: 24,666
Suppose, and then?

373
00: 34: 25,967 -> 00: 34: 28,700
I wanted to tell you that you win,
Miss Silvani.

374
00: 34: 29,854 -> 00: 34: 34,528
I realized tonight
I'm not old enough to fight

375
00: 34: 36,361 -> 00: 34: 38,610
I give it to him.
Take it whenever you want.

376
00: 34: 39,375 -> 00: 34: 42,655
I don't need your permission
Not even his sacrifice.

377
00: 34: 42,946 -> 00: 34: 45,898
I take it whenever I want!
Now tonight!

378
00: 35: 09,620 -> 00: 35: 11,120
I'm here!

379
00: 35: 11,226 -> 00: 35: 14,525
- What do you do, come in without calling?
- You were waiting for me, right?

380
00: 35: 15,984 -> 00: 35: 17,455
Take me!

381
00: 35: 17,456 -> 00: 35: 19,628
More than taking you, I break you
the brush on the head!

382
00: 35: 19,837 -> 00: 35: 22,786
Get out of my camper!
Get out of my camper!

383
00: 35: 24,499 -> 00: 35: 27,341
But, excuse me ... Excuse me ...
Why do you do comedy?

384
00: 35: 27,899 -> 00: 35: 31,797
My wife agrees, right?
Look I heard everything.

385
00: 35: 31,799 -> 00: 35: 34,446
He said he left everything to me.

386
00: 35: 37,601 -> 00: 35: 40,913
You heard everything,
but Fantozzi, did not understand anything.

387
00: 35: 41,925 -> 00: 35: 45,835
Do you also think your wife
can only give up on you?

388
00: 35: 45,915 -> 00: 35: 48,141
How? Who were they talking about?

389
00: 35: 52,812 -> 00: 35: 55,544
I get it.
Now I understand everything.

390
00: 35: 56,777 -> 00: 36: 00,373
- Goodnight. Happy New Year.
- Uhu!

391
00: 36: 07,824 -> 00: 36: 09,324
Hi.

392
00: 36: 10,365 -> 00: 36: 14,044
- How was the water?
- A little cold.

393
00: 36: 18,548 -> 00: 36: 20,048
Did you love him very much?

394
00: 36: 21,720 -> 00: 36: 27,276
I do not know. I would have liked
Try at least once.

395
00: 36: 29,352 -> 00: 36: 33,322
So it wasn't love?

396
00: 36: 34,294 -> 00: 36: 36,062
I don't know, Ugo, I've told you.

397
00: 36: 37,988 -> 00: 36: 40,762
Yes, of course, you don't know,
but if you...

398
00: 36: 41,155 -> 00: 36: 45,384
if someone asked you
out of curiosity ...

399
00: 36: 45,385 -> 00: 36: 52,022
that is, who was the man
the one you loved most in your life?

400
00: 36: 53,911 -> 00: 36: 59,131
Pina excuse me, you for me,
What are you feeling?

401
00: 37: 00,210 -> 00: 37: 04,536
- Ugo, I for you, I just feel ...
- I know, I know...

402
00: 37: 05,436 -> 00: 37: 07,750
You only feel a little tenderness.

403
00: 37: 07,951 -> 00: 37: 13,560
- No Ugo, just a little pity.
- And who loves me?

404
00: 37: 14,319 -> 00: 37: 15,966
<i> In addition to the couple crisis ... </i>

405
00: 37: 16,655 -> 00: 37: 19,650
<i> of the age drama
and unsatisfied wishes ... </i>

406
00:37: 20,292 -> 00: 37: 24,944
<i> tougher tests awaited
to the Fantozzi spouses. </i>

407
00: 37: 35,140 -> 00: 37: 37,242
Hi Pina,
Are you still there

408
00: 37: 37,619 -> 00: 37: 39,931
It's half past 8,
I'm starving!

409
00: 37: 40,000 -> 00: 37: 42,356
Understand me, I'm tired!
I worked all day! Do not?

410
00: 37: 44,730 -> 00: 37: 48,359
Come on Pina,
I'm just saying I'm hungry!

411
00: 37: 49,448 -> 00: 37: 52,693
It is not for you.
It's for MariÃ¡ngela.

412
00: 37: 53,328 -> 00: 37: 54,828
The cycle was interrupted.

413
00: 37: 54,848 -> 00: 37: 57,185
Did the bike break?
It is not a tragedy!

414
00: 37: 57,186 -> 00: 37: 59,131
- He doesn't have it anymore!
- It was stolen?

415
00: 37: 59,132 -> 00: 38: 00,616
I crap on the whore,
how many times I told him ...!

416
00: 38: 00,617 -> 00: 38: 03,869
The menstruation!
It does not come.

417
00: 38: 03,870 -> 00: 38: 10,566
Who has spoken? How,
the menstruation? Excuse me...

418
00: 38: 10,567 -> 00: 38: 13,700
listen to me, MariÃ¡ngela, as it is,
also has...

419
00: 38: 13,701 -> 00: 38: 16,613
Ugo, it's a girl
Like all the others!

420
00: 38: 18,624 -> 00: 38: 20,124
Anyway, almost ...

421
00: 38: 21,748 -> 00: 38: 23,826
- Do you see this red circle here?
- Where?

422
00: 38: 23,828 -> 00: 38: 26,858
Here! Means that
MariÃ¡ngela expects a child.

423
00: 38: 26,859 -> 00: 38: 30,138
Do you expect a child at this time?
I have hunger!

424
00: 38: 30,220 -> 00: 38: 32,339
Ugo, you are pregnant!

425
00: 38: 32,558 -> 00: 38: 34,285
I already told you that...

426
00: 38: 39,063 -> 00: 38: 43,328
Who?
Whose pregnant are we?

427
00: 38: 44,598 -> 00: 38: 47,021
Poor dear,
He didn't want to tell me, Ugo.

428
00: 38: 47,827 -> 00: 38: 51,821
She is locked in her room.
You are so afraid, you know?

429
00: 38: 52,368 -> 00: 38: 53,970
- Ugo!
- What's up, Pina?

430
00: 38: 54,743 -> 00: 38: 58.421
Come on Pina. You already know that I am
A civilized and modern father.

431
00: 38: 59,132 -> 00: 39: 03,231
And I want to face this by myself, with
understanding and sweetness It's okay?

432
00: 39: 03,299 -> 00: 39: 04,799
Let me take care.

433
00: 39: 10,518 -> 00: 39: 12,713
No, dad!
Help!

434
00: 39: 12,806 -> 00: 39: 17,238
I want to know who it was! I
I kill you! You are not a Santa Margarita!

435
00: 39: 17,386 -> 00: 39: 19,480
Come here!
I will give you two, I will give you

436
00: 39: 21,278 -> 00: 39: 25,885
For! Poor little one of mine!
Come on honey, it's nothing.

437
00: 39: 26,141 -> 00: 39: 29,003
- MariÃ¡ngela, let's go.
- Breathe?

438
00: 39: 30,755 -> 00: 39: 33,755
Is this your way of being
a civilized and modern father?

439
00: 39: 34,898 -> 00: 39: 38,266
<i> Only around 23:00,
MariÃ¡ngela confessed that the seducer ... </i>

440
00: 39: 38,656 -> 00: 39: 42,433
<i> was a post colleague.
One Batacchi Loris. </i>

441
00: 39: 43,273 -> 00: 39: 45,398
<i> They decided to go visit him at home. </i>

442
00: 39: 45,871 -> 00: 39: 49,480
<i> They also devised a great plan </i>

443
00: 39: 49,725 -> 00: 39: 55,276
<i> to confess and do
face your responsibilities. </i>

444
00: 39: 56,304 -> 00: 39: 59,269
I'm coming, I'm coming, my little girl.
How impatient you are!

445
00: 39: 59,377 -> 00: 40: 00,877
I already have it hard ...

446
00: 40: 01,954 -> 00: 40: 04,566
Excuse me, I was waiting for a girl.
What do they want?

447
00: 40: 05,449 -> 00: 40: 07,997
We are from the Protection Committee
of Young Women.

448
00: 40: 08,199 -> 00: 40: 12,157
Then they are full of merchandise!
Come, pass, that interests me a lot.

449
00: 40: 12,354 -> 00: 40: 14,151
Go ahead, ma'am. Don't fear

450
00: 40: 16,615 -> 00: 40: 18,727
Let me
I'm Loris Batacchi

451
00: 40: 19,522 -> 00: 40: 22,973
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I kiss his hand! And those girls?

452
00: 40: 23,042 -> 00: 40: 23,847
What girls are you talking about?

453
00: 40: 23,848 -> 00: 40: 27,946
- We are doing a survey.
- About one of the dangers for girls.

454
00: 40: 27,959 -> 00: 40: 29,459
- The seducers!
- That's.

455
00: 40: 29,686 -> 00: 40: 33,275
Then they had a great ass.
They have finger with the biggest!

456
00: 40: 33,276 -> 00: 40: 34,776
With the best of the best!

457
00: 40: 35,301 -> 00: 40: 37,862
Please sit down
Sit down, ma'am. Sit down.

458
00: 40: 37,967 -> 00: 40: 42,255
If there was an entity of seducers,
I would be life president!

459
00: 40: 42,556 -> 00: 40: 44,056
Six thousand victims!

460
00: 40: 44,217 -> 00: 40: 46,522
Almost the number of inhabitants
of San ArcÃ¡ngelo de Romagna!

461
00: 40: 47,189 -> 00: 40: 50,860
- Congratulations.
- Modestly, I deserve them.

462
00: 40: 51,053 -> 00: 40: 55,077
No, this is an optional!
I have all the accessories.

463
00: 40: 55,247 -> 00: 40: 58,172
Take, have fun. Please take it.
It does not bite.

464
00: 40: 59,512 -> 00: 41: 02,470
There is a bit of mess,
But you know, it's like my office.

465
00: 41: 02,512 -> 00: 41: 06,128
My work environment And now,
Ask me without restrictions ...

466
00: 41: 06,509 -> 00: 41: 09,769
I don't have hairs on my tongue
momentarily.

467
00: 41: 10,229 -> 00: 41: 12,070
- Eh no!
- Do you understand the double meaning?

468
00: 41: 12,071 -> 00: 41: 15,831
- Can you explain what this is?
- For the lady to have fun ...

469
00: 41: 16,115 -> 00: 41: 18,474
I better keep it.
I leave it here.

470
00: 41: 18,686 -> 00: 41: 22,129
Would you be so kind, sir,
Tell me where you work?

471
00: 41: 22,556 -> 00: 41: 25,692
I work at the Post Office!
Head of the "Packages" Office!

472
00: 41: 25,693 -> 00: 41: 27,193
Wait!

473
00: 41: 27,674 -> 00: 41: 29,288
You can explain ...
the concept.

474
00: 41: 29,289 -> 00: 41: 32,215
I know, but could not use
more appropriate terms ...?

475
00: 41: 32,216 -> 00: 41: 34,862
- Clearer than this!
- Be nice to my wife.

476
00: 41: 34,908 -> 00: 41: 37,737
- It's okay.
- Do you know Miss Fantozzi?

477
00: 41: 38,152 -> 00: 41: 41,108
- MariÃ¡ngela Fantozzi.
- MariÃ¡ngela Fantossi ...

478
00: 41: 41,109 -> 00: 41: 43,888
- Fantozzi ...
- What do you want, Fantossi?

479
00: 41: 43,889 -> 00: 41: 47,405
- Fantozzi.
- Yes, with the zeta, I understand. I'm not an idiot.

480
00: 41: 48,071 -> 00: 41: 52,753
Fantossi, I'll look at the file.
Where there are very good girls.

481
00: 41: 52,899 -> 00: 41: 55,238
Sorry,
What is your charge then?

482
00: 41: 55,609 -> 00: 41: 57,031
Head of the "Packages" Office!

483
00: 41: 57,032 -> 00: 42: 01,862
- Please! He has already said it ...
- Here it is. "Fantossi, MariÃ¡ngela".

484
00: 42: 02,513 -> 00: 42: 05,383
Yes, she is a colleague.
A subaltern of mine.

485
00: 42: 06,400 -> 00: 42: 09,024
And you are from the Association
of Young Women Protectors?

486
00: 42: 10,225 -> 00: 42: 14,358
Naughty!
They will be from the Animal Guard!

487
00: 42: 14,493 -> 00: 42: 16,753
What is this? It is terribly ugly.

488
00: 42: 17,361 -> 00: 42: 20,204
- He's a guy!
- One type? A type of monkey!

489
00: 42: 20,387 -> 00: 42: 23,569
The ugliest guy in Europe.
Yes, I remember her.

490
00: 42: 23,595 -> 00: 42: 25,691
One of my greatest satisfactions.

491
00: 42: 25,700 -> 00: 42: 28,831
It was a desperate gesture.
I bet with some friends.

492
00: 42: 29,032 -> 00: 42: 32,098
One million,
If I hit the orangutan.

493
00: 42: 32,336 -> 00: 42: 34,416
- Her name is MariÃ¡ngela!
- MariÃ¡ngela?

494
00: 42: 34,517 -> 00: 42: 36,766
This is an orangutan,
other than MariÃ¡ngela.

495
00: 42: 37,223 -> 00: 42: 40,168
Look, I tell you how it was.
I told myself...

496
00: 42: 40,469 -> 00: 42: 43,581
"do it in the dark,
because with light you will not be able to ".

497
00: 42: 43,746 -> 00: 42: 46,733
I took her to the baghouse.
It was all dark ...

498
00: 42: 46,743 -> 00: 42: 51,200
Outside there was a storm.
I supported her there and gave and gave and gave!

499
00: 42: 51,201 -> 00: 42: 52,767
Blindly, where it entered, it entered.

500
00: 42: 52,780 -> 00: 42: 55,418
I didn't even know what I was doing,
I let myself be guided by the beast.

501
00: 42: 55,475 -> 00: 42: 58,548
I mean by MariÃ¡ngela?
I mean ... for the girl.

502
00: 42: 58,949 -> 00: 43: 00,026
No, for the "snake"!

503
00: 43: 00,027 -> 00: 43: 02,869
If I already told you what is in the package!
The snake!

504
00: 43: 03,198 -> 00: 43: 05,689
It's a cobra
It swells the head and attacks.

505
00: 43: 05,731 -> 00: 43: 09,625
Jump and nothing stops her!
And the lady knows, right?

506
00: 43: 09,626 -> 00: 43: 11,126
Ugo, please do something!

507
00: 43: 11,386 -> 00: 43: 16,242
Listen! Listen sir!
I remind you for the second time ...

508
00: 43: 16,243 -> 00: 43: 20,069
to use one more language
Civilized with my wife!

509
00: 43: 20,070 -> 00: 43: 20,917
Why?

510
00: 43: 20,918 -> 00: 43: 23,698
Because he is my wife, and he is not
accustomed to these things.

511
00: 43: 23,699 -> 00: 43: 25,569
But we familiarize it right away,
don't worry!

512
00: 43: 26,890 -> 00: 43: 32,083
I want to say that my wife and I
We are MariÃ¡ngela's parents.

513
00: 43: 32,279 -> 00: 43: 35,492
- Of the orangutan?
- I mean, this lady is my wife ...

514
00: 43: 35,860 -> 00: 43: 37,360
The lady is the mother?

515
00: 43: 38,133 -> 00: 43: 40,556
But what a beautiful mom
We have here.

516
00: 43: 41,557 -> 00: 43: 43,257
How is it going?
Look how pretty!

517
00: 43: 43,429 -> 00: 43: 45,561
- It must be one of those that enjoy little.
- How I know...!

518
00: 43: 45,725 -> 00: 43: 48,464
I'll take care of it, here I am!
What a beautiful mom!

519
00: 43: 48,765 -> 00: 43: 50,565
How old are you?
48, 49 years?

520
00: 43: 50,566 -> 00: 43: 51,264
Forty-four.

521
00: 43: 51,265 -> 00: 43: 53,864
Forty-four?
I will put her in treatment.

522
00: 43: 53,865 -> 00: 43: 55,874
One week of treatment ...

523
00: 43: 55,875 -> 00: 43: 59,865
and the hair color will change.
She'll be blonde, if I lay her there!

524
00: 44: 00,404 -> 00: 44: 01,904
- Please!
- Do you know what they call me?

525
00: 44: 01,928 -> 00: 44: 03,975
- They call me "the crazy of the spatula"!
- How?

526
00: 44: 03,976 -> 00: 44: 07,140
I drive the lady crazy.
You will see how physiognomy changes.

527
00: 44: 08,281 -> 00: 44: 11,592
Know that I have a great collection
of pornographic posters,

528
00: 44: 11,879 -> 00: 44: 15,511
with all the movements,
the positions. I call her "La Via Crucis".

529
00: 44: 15,926 -> 00: 44: 18,820
We will stop at all seasons
until you reach the end!

530
00: 44: 19,066 -> 00: 44: 23,880
Hey degenerate, at those stations,
take your sister!

531
00: 44: 23,933 -> 00: 44: 25,599
- Yes!
- To her sister?

532
00: 44: 25,700 -> 00: 44: 27,500
- Do you also have a sister?
- How?

533
00: 44: 28,371 -> 00: 44: 30,847
Bring her to her too,
everything is grace of God!

534
00: 44: 30,848 -> 00: 44: 33,422
- I pass the spatula to her too!
- How do you dare?

535
00: 44: 33,623 -> 00: 44: 35,223
She will also be blonde!

536
00: 44: 36,287 -> 00: 44: 38,532
Do you know what I do to them,
"the crazy of the spatula"?

537
00: 44: 38,543 -> 00: 44: 41,370
Know what? First take
to the lady and the little sister ...

538
00: 44: 41,871 -> 00: 44: 43,371
and I put them here at two.

539
00: 44: 43,481 -> 00: 44: 45,062
Be careful,
I explain.

540
00: 44: 45,337 -> 00: 44: 49,178
Then I put them like this,
And I rip this off!

541
00: 44: 49,479 -> 00: 44: 51,785
Understands?
Then I rip it to the other!

542
00: 44: 51,986 -> 00: 44: 55,002
And then, one on this side
and the other one.

543
00: 44: 55,467 -> 00: 44: 57,944
And inside with the spatula!
Come too!

544
00: 44: 58,345 -> 00: 45: 00,603
Come you too
I drive him crazy!

545
00: 45: 00,840 -> 00: 45: 02,486
- I give it with the spatula!
- Nerd...

546
00: 45: 02,523 -> 00: 45: 05,930
- I'm leaving!
- Nerd. Stay with me ...

547
00: 45: 05,931 -> 00: 45: 08,488
that I add it to the file, yes?
Do you have a photograph?

548
00: 45: 09,089 -> 00: 45: 10,316
We will use the driving license!

549
00: 45: 10,317 -> 00: 45: 11,587
Ugo, don't trust!

550
00: 45: 11,588 -> 00: 45: 16,177
I give spatula
because I'm a male with balls!

551
00: 45: 16,389 -> 00: 45: 17,995
- Where were we?
- Let us go fast!

552
00: 45: 18,096 -> 00: 45: 21,596
Listen to me, we are pregnant.
I mean...

553
00: 45: 21,656 -> 00: 45: 24,055
- And MariÃ¡ngela?
- Do you want to give it to that one?

554
00: 45: 24,287 -> 00: 45: 26,423
Yes, increasingly difficult!

555
00: 45: 26,724 -> 00: 45: 28,657
To this statuette
I also give it!

556
00: 45: 28,858 -> 00: 45: 30,658
No two powders without three!

557
00: 45: 30,801 -> 00: 45: 32,301
Do you know what I say,
Dear Sir?

558
00: 45: 32,456 -> 00: 45: 35,636
We don't care about anything
of your cushions ...!

559
00: 45: 35,837 -> 00: 45: 37,218
- Cushions!
- His balls!

560
00: 45: 37,219 -> 00: 45: 38,757
Not even his spatula!

561
00: 45: 38,758 -> 00: 45: 40,136
- That's!
- Bye.

562
00: 45: 40,137 -> 00: 45: 43,236
- Hey ... will it really drive me crazy?
- Walk!

Good morning, doctor, do you want to do
a business? I have a fresh liver.

568
00: 46: 06,294 -> 00: 46: 07,950
I have a heart
transplanted of the day.

569
00: 46: 10,952 -> 00: 46: 13,525
- I'm not interested.
- It's a unique opportunity, Doctor.

570
00: 46: 13,617 -> 00: 46: 16,428
- I'm not interested in those articles.
- Tomorrow I might need them!

571
00: 46: 16,587 -> 00: 46: 18,593
- Bye!
- Do you need blood for transfusion?

572

- I have a negative HR.
- Has a guarantee against hepatitis.

573

- Thirty thousand.

583
00: 47: 07,256 -> 00: 47: 11,900
With the teacher...
All right. One, two and three.

584
00: 47: 12,046 -> 00: 47: 13,809
The teacher is on vacation.

585

Now, thirty, then ...

Sorry if I have not thought about it.
I give it ten and it gives me the change.

591
00: 47: 38,185 -> 00: 47: 39,842

Then hey ...

592
00: 47: 40,043 -> 00: 47: 44,113

Let's make a truce ...

593
00: 47: 44,114 -> 00: 47: 46,195

00: 48: 44,334 -> 00: 48: 46,234
- Come, dear, come.
- He is wrong ...

615
00: 48: 46,297 -> 00: 48: 49,541
- Come to your room.
- How? I have to go there.

616
00: 48: 49,584 -> 00: 48: 51,812
- We will take good care of you.
- Yes, I know, but I ...

617
00: 48: 52,177 -> 00: 48: 55,035
- Calm down, come on!
- Please release my arm!

618
00: 48: 55,138 -> 00: 48: 58,363
- Do not push! Let me go sister!
- Still!

619
00: 49: 01,074 -> 00: 49: 03,468
Excuse me but...
That makes?

620
00: 49: 03,709 -> 00: 49: 05,656
Will it be possible?
Sister!

621
00: 49: 09,547 -> 00: 49: 11,250
Sister, then ...

622
00: 49: 14,320 -> 00: 49: 18,249
You are lucky
Here they are all lucky.

623
00: 49: 18,421 -> 00: 49: 22,412
The doctors are controlling them
with very sophisticated devices.

624
00: 49: 22,840 -> 00: 49: 25,001
The latest findings
in the field of technology

625
00: 49: 28,719 -> 00: 49: 30,219
Stay calm.

626
00: 49: 32,341 -> 00: 49: 33,841
Good job.

627
00: 49: 36,706 -> 00: 49: 38,206
Excuse me, you would know ...

628
00: 49: 50,719 -> 00: 49: 53,623
- That's it, I won!
- Very good!

629
00: 49: 53,742 -> 00: 49: 55,242
Well done!

630
00: 50: 21,078 -> 00: 50: 22,578
Here you go.

631
00: 50: 23,187 -> 00: 50: 25,025
THE PRIMARY IS ON ROUND

632
00: 50: 29,245 -> 00: 50: 30,745
- Have.
- Thank you.

633
00: 50: 31,114 -> 00: 50: 33,714
Hey, could you tell me
where is the big room?

634
00: 50: 33,973 -> 00: 50: 35,945
- You ask me?
- How?

635
00: 50: 37,721 -> 00: 50: 39,894
Hey, are you not a stretcher?

636
00: 50: 40,369 -> 00: 50: 43,821
I? What are you talking about?
I am a pizza maker in the restaurant.

637
00: 50: 44,122 -> 00: 50: 47,528
I have come to visit my mother,
That is very, very serious.

638
00: 50: 53,591 -> 00: 50: 56,828
- Oh, the disabled!
- Do not!

639
00: 50: 59,154 -> 00: 51: 01,533
Wait, wait a moment!
Wait a moment!

640
00: 51: 02,673 -> 00: 51: 04,600
Arm...
It is hurting me.

641
00: 51: 09,100 -> 00: 51: 10,880
Sister, I am not disabled.

642
00: 51: 11,905 -> 00: 51: 14,780
- I have it.
- It can hurt.

643
00: 51: 15,479 -> 00: 51: 17,521
- Now come to your sector.
- What sector are you talking about?

644
00: 51: 17,601 -> 00: 51: 19,450
- Clmese!
- That makes!

645
00: 51: 20,069 -> 00: 51: 21,953
- Do not.
- I'll show you what's below!

646
00: 51: 33,770 -> 00: 51: 35,483
- Have you taken everything?
- Yes, teacher.

647
00: 51: 36,022 -> 00: 51: 37,773
- It is true that...
- If true.

648
00: 51: 37,774 -> 00: 51: 40,916
- You'll need some time.
- It would be better to have him here one more day.

649
00: 51: 41,384 -> 00: 51: 46,299
Excuse me, Mr. Professor Engineer
Grandi "Mahatma Grandi."

650
00: 51: 46,472 -> 00: 51: 50,131
- Sorry, what is that?
- It's 50 thousand lire.

651
00: 51: 50,201 -> 00: 51: 54,501
- How is it allowed? Save that!
- Excuse me, I didn't think ...

652
00: 51: 54,551 -> 00: 51: 57.613
- What does he want?
- Me, I'm here, unfortunately ...

653
00: 51: 57.614 -> 00: 51: 59.514
to terminate a pregnancy

654
00: 52: 00,941 -> 00: 52: 03,135
No, it's not for me.
It's for my simia ...

655
00: 52: 03,136 -> 00: 52: 05,503
... for my daughter ... sim ... daughter!
- No, that never!

656
00: 52: 05,652 -> 00: 52: 09,313
Excuse me, I didn't know but
thanks to Panella they passed the law ...

657
00: 52: 09,314 -> 00: 52: 11,613
I am catholic,
conscientious objector.

658
00: 52: 11,814 -> 00: 52: 15,255
And above all, orthopedist.
Therefore, ignorant in that matter.

659
00: 52: 15,723 -> 00: 52: 17,766
Yes, but they told me that you,
Professor Mahatma ...

660
00: 52: 18,267 -> 00: 52: 20,008
Mahatma Grandi,
replaces the gynecologist.

661
00: 52: 20,193 -> 00: 52: 23,483
Well, I do what I can.
But I have a very high percentage ...

662
00: 52: 23,484 -> 00: 52: 25,128
... of unfortunate events.
- How?

663
00: 52: 25,244 -> 00: 52: 31,211
Hey, dear, do me a favor.
Wait for Professor Marini to return.

664
00: 52: 31,313 -> 00: 52: 35,451
- And in the meantime, what do I do?
- Meanwhile, reserve a bed.

665
00: 52: 35,478 -> 00: 52: 37,147
And how long does it take?

666
00: 52: 37,594 -> 00: 52: 39,175
If all goes well, two years.

667
00: 52: 40,959 -> 00: 52: 46,324
Two years? But Mahatma Grandi,
A pregnancy takes only nine months.

668
00: 52: 46,325 -> 00: 52: 49,772
- Oh yeah?
- But hey, you don't know?

669
00: 52: 49,852 -> 00: 52: 51,387
I have already told him
I'm an orthopedist

670
00: 52: 51,788 -> 00: 52: 54,388
Nine months?
Then your case is urgent.

671
00: 52: 54,600 -> 00: 52: 55,056
- Do you have a million?
- Wait. Yes.

672
00: 52: 58.057 -> 00: 53: 01.057
- Use it, then.
- Excuse my curiosity.

673
00: 53: 01,608 -> 00: 53: 06,074
- Before 50 thousand lire not ...
- Well, it was only 50 thousand lire.

674
00: 53: 06,075 -> 00: 53: 07,999
But dear
Who had I taken?

675
00: 53: 08,000 -> 00: 53: 10,008
- For a stretcher?
- Take

676
00: 53: 10,009 -> 00: 53: 12,825
No, I don't touch it!
Everyone is a witness!

677
00: 53: 12,826 -> 00: 53: 14,326
- Everybody.
- Give it to the sister.

678
00: 53: 14,554 -> 00: 53: 16,054
- Bye dear.
- Goodbye.

679
00: 53: 16,147 -> 00: 53: 18,977
- Sister, take it to the individual.
- Alright then...

680
00: 53: 19,890 -> 00: 53: 23,074
<i> The room where Fantozzi spent the night
to reserve a place for the daughter ... </i>

681
00: 53: 23,735 -> 00: 53: 29,486
<i> it was not a room. It was the fearsome
Operating room of Professor Zambrini Loredan. </i>

682
00: 53: 29,753 -> 00: 53: 31,815
<i> Nicknamed "Jack the Ripper." </i>

683
00: 53: 32,016 -> 00: 53: 33,516
What's going on?

684
00: 53: 33,603 -> 00: 53: 34,716
Shut up.

685
00: 53: 34,717 -> 00: 53: 36,917
- Sister, have mercy.
- Don't worry, don't shake.

686
00: 53: 37,254 -> 00: 53: 40,210
They make a mistake.
I am here for my daughter.

687
00: 53: 40,211 -> 00: 53: 41,890
We know well
why are you here. Quiet!

688
00: 53: 41,991 -> 00: 53: 44,485
But,
What do you want to do to me?

689
00: 53: 48,204 -> 00: 53: 51,956
No, don't do that to me,
I'm weak from bladder

690
00: 54: 01,467 -> 00: 54: 03,456
- Well, bravo!
- Bravo!

691
00: 54: 07,626 -> 00: 54: 09,943
- Scalpel.
- How, "scalpel"?

692
00: 54: 11,953 -> 00: 54: 13,453
Has it hurt you?

693
00: 54: 15,697 -> 00: 54: 17,197
What do we have to operate?

694
00: 54: 17,479 -> 00: 54: 19,982
- Ah, I don't know.
- File!

695
00: 54: 20,012 -> 00: 54: 23,553
Teacher...
Professor, I don't have a record.

696
00: 54: 28,941 -> 00: 54: 30,771
Teacher,
Here is not the tab.

697
00: 54: 31,472 -> 00: 54: 33,272
- Isn't the tab?
- It is not, it is not.

698
00: 54: 33,373 -> 00: 54: 37,417
But I think they said you have to
amputate something that ends in "azo".

699
00: 54: 37,968 -> 00: 54: 44,261
"Azo", "azo"?
Arm ... amputation of the arm.

700
00: 54: 44,321 -> 00: 54: 45,660
Mountain range!

701
00: 54: 45,661 -> 00: 54: 47,161
An arm?

702
00: 54: 48,061 -> 00: 54: 49,261
- An arm?
- Yes.

703
00: 54: 49,262 -> 00: 54: 50,762
No, not an arm.

704
00: 54: 51,237 -> 00: 54: 53,067
It could also be a "piece."

705
00: 54: 53,068 -> 00: 54: 55,579
- "Piece"?
- Arm, a "piece" ...

706
00: 54: 55,580 -> 00: 54: 59,265
- When in doubt, we amputate everything!
- No, not everything!

707
00: 54: 59,766 -> 00: 55: 04,070
Professor, in the goal they said that
it ended in "al", not "azo".

708
00: 55: 05,200 -> 00: 55: 09,848
But guys, then I could
be a kidney stone,

709
00: 55: 10,049 -> 00: 55: 12,264
anal fissure,
intestinal tamponade ...

710
00: 55: 12,365 -> 00: 55: 13,865
... postal stamp.

711
00: 55: 15,423 -> 00: 55: 16,923
- Silence!
- Sorry.

712
00: 55: 17,262 -> 00: 55: 18,762
Wait teacher!

713
00: 55: 19,203 -> 00: 55: 21,400
- Yes, is here!
- The token!

714
00: 55: 21,401 -> 00: 55: 22,901
- The token!
- Here it is.

715
00: 55: 23,175 -> 00: 55: 25,588
Well done, beautiful,
beautiful, good ...

716
00: 55: 25,589 -> 00: 55: 28,777
- Beautiful sister! Yes Yes!
- Teacher!

717
00: 55: 29,309 -> 00: 55: 33,228
- That makes?
- I've had a moment of ... excuse me.

718
00: 55: 33,229 -> 00: 55: 34,929
It is the heat of the lamp.

719
00: 55: 35,730 -> 00: 55: 36,888
The record, Professor.

720
00: 55: 36,889 -> 00: 55: 39,619
<i> The file belonged
to one Baccellari Vincenzo, </i>

721

Scissors NÂº 0,1.

728
00: 55: 57,570 -> 00: 55: 59,070
- Take.
- Pass me the magnifying glass.

736

<i> When Fantozzi was released,
MariÃ¡ngela was serving her time. </i>

737
00: 56: 34,172 -> 00: 56: 36,001
Dad mom!

738
00: 56: 36,239 -> 00: 56: 37,739
Does it move!

739
00: 56: 38,141 -> 00: 56: 41,035
Where who?
Who is moving?

740
00: 56: 44,587 -> 00: 56: 47,457
- He tapped.
- Let me hear ...

741
00: 56: 51,968 -> 00: 56: 55,698
It's true, tap.

742

<i> Two days later,
contractions arrived. </i>

743

- There is! Do you hear her
- What do we do?

744
00: 57: 04,728 -> 00: 57: 06,475
Wait here
I will go to them.

745
00: 57: 09,022 -> 00: 57: 11,048
Here here!
Turning over the corner!

746
00: 57: 23,033 -> 00: 57: 27,990
<i> Fantozzi was forced to wear
to the stretchers to the hospital. </i>

747
00: 57: 37,534 -> 00: 57: 39,034
There is! There is!

748
00: 57: 40,671 -> 00: 57: 42,880
Have you seen that beautiful boy,
Mr. Rossi?

749
00: 57: 44,991 -> 00: 57: 47,226
- Like what "Mr. Rossi"?
- You are not Mr. Rossi?

750
00: 57: 47,227 -> 00: 57: 51,367
- No, my name is Fantozzi.
- Sorry, where is Mr. Rossi?

751
00: 57: 52,223 -> 00: 57: 55,037
It happens frequently.
Now it's your turn.

752
00: 57: 56,138 -> 00: 57: 58,238
- Do not get scared.
- Nerd.

753
00: 57: 58,339 -> 00: 58: 01,870
The birth, Mr. Fantozzi,
It is natural.

754
00: 58: 02,277 -> 00: 58: 06,693
Being born is beautiful. It is wonderful.
Its beautiful!

755
00: 58: 12,542 -> 00: 58: 15,827
- How will this child be?
- Beautiful

756
00: 58: 17,027 -> 00: 58: 20,562
Do you remember how pretty
was MariÃ¡ngela when she was born?

757
00: 58: 32,252 -> 00: 58: 34,097
Faster Faster!
The doctor has passed out.

758
00: 58: 35,424 -> 00: 58: 37,811

Pina, who is it?

764
00: 59: 03,693 -> 00: 59: 08,043
- For our grandfather.
- Hip, hip, hip, hooray!

765

No, it doesn't seem like anything.

Describe it.

- Just a moment. I do not remember...

- At the idiot's launch!

801

- A thief! A thief!

- No, it's not my car.
- Nor mine, lawyer.

01: 01: 56,769 -> 01: 02: 02,000
- And what is it, an alarm?
- No, it's not a car. It comes from up there.

809
01: 02: 02,001 -> 01: 02: 03,501
It seems the alarm
of an apartment

- Silence!
- Enough, you can't sleep!

01: 12: 24,926 -> 01: 12: 30,071
<i> It was just a tragic trick for
being forced to run faster. </i>

920
01: 12: 30,627 -> 01: 12: 34,127
<i> In the stadium bathrooms
a macabre raffle had taken place ... </i>

921
01: 12: 34,428 -> 01: 12: 36,543
<i> for the place of last runner. </i>

922
01: 12: 37,277 -> 01: 12: 40,471
<i> It turned out winner
the luckiest ... </i>

923
01: 12: 41,072 -> 01: 12: 42,549
<i> ... Fantozzi. </i>

924
01: 12: 42,550 -> 01: 12: 44,890
Fly, Capuchin, Fly!

925
01: 12: 47,344 -> 01: 12: 49,860
- Watch out!
- It's going to explode!

926
01: 12: 51,661 -> 01: 12: 53,161
Let's run fast!

927
01: 12: 54,103 -> 01: 12: 56,024
- Look how dad runs!
- Yes.

928
01: 12: 57,878 -> 01: 12: 59,378
Dad has arrived first!

929
01: 13: 05,236 -> 01: 13: 09,265
<i> And the elections came.
Naturally ahead. </i>

930
01: 13: 09,489 -> 01: 13: 13,375
<i> Fantozzi, who felt very much
your right and duty as a citizen, </i>

931
01: 13: 13,524 -> 01: 13: 16,837
<i> participated from uncertainty,
from indecision ... </i>

932
01: 13: 17,061 -> 01: 13: 19,454
<i> and from fear
to be wrong again. </i>

933
01: 13: 19,833 -> 01: 13: 21,945
<i> Then he began to read everything. </i>

934
01: 13: 22,046 -> 01: 13: 24,511
<i> From the extreme right
to the extreme left. </i>

935
01: 13: 24,512 -> 01: 13: 26,012
Just need you
"Sardinian Commerce".

936
01: 13: 26,037 -> 01: 13: 27,877
- Give it to me! How much?
- It's 50 thousand.

937
01: 13: 32,655 -> 01: 13: 34,487
<i> Then he reported sick, </i>

938
01: 13: 34,850 -> 01: 13: 39,005
<i> and locked himself in his house,
in the TV room. </i>

939
01: 13: 39,644 -> 01: 13: 41,254
- What's up, Pina?
- Do you want to snack?

940
01: 13: 41,460 -> 01: 13: 43,146
I want nothing.
Can't you see what I'm looking at?

941
01: 13: 43,647 -> 01: 13: 45,447
But you have not eaten for two days.

942
01: 13: 45,663 -> 01: 13: 47,319
Pina, listen to me well.

943
01: 13: 47,320 -> 01: 13: 51,349
If I'm wrong with the vote, this time
We will finish without eating 10 years!

944
01: 13: 51,550 -> 01: 13: 53,083
So out, out!

945
01: 13: 53,584 -> 01: 13: 55,253
- It's okay.
- And bring me a strong coffee.

946
01: 13: 56,973 -> 01: 14: 00,608
<i> From morning to night
no political debate was lost, </i>

947
01: 14: 00,609 -> 01: 14: 04,058
<i> not an electoral act, not a debate
of four, not even a ping pong, </i>

948
01: 14: 04,359 -> 01: 14: 07,752
<i> not a round table.
On all existing channels, </i>

949
01: 14: 07,853 -> 01: 14: 11,673
<i> public and private,
and on the three televisions in the house. </i>

950
01: 14: 12,625 -> 01: 14: 16,847
<i> Disoriented by all the information
and the jarring bells, </i>

951
01: 14: 17,348 -> 01: 14: 19,945
<i> came in soon
in the most complete burden, </i>

952
01: 14: 20,277 -> 01: 14: 24,605
<i> and began to suffer
audiovisual hallucinations. </i>

953
01: 14: 25,546 -> 01: 14: 27,305
Fast with me
fellow Fantozzi!

954
01: 14: 27,372 -> 01: 14: 31,842
It will be an extraordinary demonstration,
against these scammers.

955
01: 14: 32,201 -> 01: 14: 33,346
That is a great idea.

956
01: 14: 33,347 -> 01: 14: 35,883
The leader and the last idiot
of society, that is you,

957
01: 14: 36,084 -> 01: 14: 37,884
hunger strike

958
01: 14: 38,485 -> 01: 14: 41,575
I drink "capuccinos"
and you pay them to me.

959
01: 14: 41,844 -> 01: 14: 44,289
You are a professional,
He is used to fasting.

960
01: 14: 44,490 -> 01: 14: 48,210
I, Fantozzi, as you can see,
I am not prone to fasting.

961
01: 14: 48,711 -> 01: 14: 49,562
Noticeable.

962
01: 14: 49,563 -> 01: 14: 52,068
But this time I agree
with the honorable Pannella,

963
01: 14: 52,369 -> 01: 14: 55,092
in which you
the stoic condemned to fasting,

964
01: 14: 55,293 -> 01: 14: 57,835
dear Fantozzi,
limiting consumption

965
01: 14: 58,536 -> 01: 15: 00,095
- Even more?
- Clear!

966
01: 15: 00,196 -> 01: 15: 03,536
Go have four or
five holes in the belt,

967
01: 15: 03,637 -> 01: 15: 05,677
while I'm leaving
to my humble farm in Florence ...

968
01: 15: 05,678 -> 01: 15: 10,517
and I eat good ribs
Empanadas, with fries.

969
01: 15: 11,700 -> 01: 15: 15,680
I ask him to support the match
of the most relative majority.

970
01: 15: 16,174 -> 01: 15: 19,220
Especially for good
of your psychic health.

971
01: 15: 19,421 -> 01: 15: 20,221
Clear.

972
01: 15: 20,222 -> 01: 15: 24,471
You, after 40 years of use and abuse
Continues of the Christian Democrats,

973
01: 15: 24,904 -> 01: 15: 27,458
has become
in a "DC-dependent."

974
01: 15: 28,130 -> 01: 15: 32,092
What would I do without Blessed Senator Fanfani,
great benefactor of your party?

975
01: 15: 32,593 -> 01: 15: 35,121
- And without the most holy Mariano Rumor?
- Good Morning.

976
01: 15: 35,546 -> 01: 15: 39,781
And without the honorable Rognoni,
for so many years Minister of the Interior?

977
01: 15: 40,082 -> 01: 15: 42,667
- Ah, that's why Rognoni!
- Vote for DC, Fantozzi,

978
01: 15: 43,252 -> 01: 15: 46,361
or will have a withdrawal crisis
surely fatal.

979
01: 15: 46,362 -> 01: 15: 46,862
Fatal?

980
01: 15: 46,863 -> 01: 15: 48,819
Ignore him,
fellow Fantozzi!

981
01: 15: 49,720 -> 01: 15: 50,312
Good.

982
01: 15: 50,313 -> 01: 15: 53,546
You are the exploited classic,
You are the prototype of the exploited.

983
01: 15: 54,347 -> 01: 15: 55,947
Well, you must change.

984
01: 15: 56,452 -> 01: 15: 57,241
Of hairstyle?

985
01: 15: 57,242 -> 01: 15: 59,746
You have to renew yourself.
You must change operator.

986
01: 16: 00,697 -> 01: 16: 02,580
You already tried with everyone,
try us

987
01: 16: 02,781 -> 01: 16: 04,934
I assure you
That we are not less than anyone.

988
01: 16: 04,935 -> 01: 16: 06,435
That is...

989
01: 16: 07,531 -> 01: 16: 10,044
You see, Fantozzi accountant,
if you support my party ...

990
01: 16: 10,045 -> 01: 16: 12,475
I promise to solve
The problem of retirement.

991
01: 16: 12,576 -> 01: 16: 14,820
- Thank you, very human.
- Why do you thank me?

992
01: 16: 14,821 -> 01: 16: 17,275
I talked about my retirement.
Not yours!

993
01: 16: 17,276 -> 01: 16: 19,831
I'm already a certain age
and a mother in charge.

994
01: 16: 20,273 -> 01: 16: 23,633
Excuse me do you want me
I take care of your mother?

995
01: 16: 23,979 -> 01: 16: 27,366
- No, no, no, no, Fantozzi!
- No, instead yes, yes, yes, yes!

996
01: 16: 27,569 -> 01: 16: 29,813
The breast does not touch.
Look me in the eye!

997
01: 16: 29,814 -> 01: 16: 32,342
No, don't look at me like that!

998
01: 16: 33,006 -> 01: 16: 35,948
If you kindly
give me your address,

999
01: 16: 35,949 -> 01: 16: 39,321
I will send some comrades
to give him gently ...

1000
01: 16: 39,531 -> 01: 16: 41,627
a good side dish
of castor oil,

1001
01: 16: 41,628 -> 01: 16: 44,352
to clarify
Our electoral program.

1002
01: 16: 44,777 -> 01: 16: 46,151
We can not
leave it for later?

1003
01: 16: 46,152 -> 01: 16: 48,407
What do I think of Fantozzi?
I will speak to you as a woman.

1004
01: 16: 48,408 -> 01: 16: 51,165
I will tell him that I find him
Disgusting like a toad.

1005
01: 16: 51,966 -> 01: 16: 52,985
You too?

1006
01: 16: 52,986 -> 01: 16: 56,748
We care a lot
next fall and winter

1007
01: 16: 57,241 -> 01: 16: 59,117
What is there to do,
dear Fantozzi?

1008
01: 16: 59,500 -> 01: 17: 01,470
- If you ask me ...
- Me, with Lama and with Carniti,

1009
01: 17: 01,471 -> 01: 17: 06,334
we have decided to fight to the end
to invite us all three ...

1010
01: 17: 06,435 -> 01: 17: 11,002
to Agnelli's yacht, to do
a Mediterranean cruise,

1011
01: 17: 11,003 -> 01: 17: 13,953
... to the Seychelles or Bermuda.
- They never invite me!

1012
01: 17: 14,174 -> 01: 17: 16,051
What do you want me to say,
Fantozzi companion?

1013
01: 17: 16,252 -> 01: 17: 18,205
The serious problem
It is the stability.

1014
01: 17: 18,406 -> 01: 17: 20,908
If you vote for me,
I will firmly establish myself ...

1015
01: 17: 20,909 -> 01: 17: 22,803
in the stable Government Palace.

1016
01: 17: 22,904 -> 01: 17: 25,720
And they can't get me out of there
Not even cannon shots.

1017
01: 17: 25,814 -> 01: 17: 31,409
Excuse me, Duce, I mean honorable,
How would your stability benefit me?

1018
01: 17: 31,647 -> 01: 17: 36,414
All the games, dear Fantozzi,
They are still promising economic improvements ...

1019
01: 17: 36,415 -> 01: 17: 39,955
that never arrived
And they will never come.

1020
01: 17: 40,256 -> 01: 17: 41,066
Never!

1021
01: 17: 41,067 -> 01: 17: 44,836
We will not be able to disappoint you,
because this time we promise

1022
01: 17: 44,837 -> 01: 17: 49,349
What's more, we assure you of a worsening
Five-year and progressive.

1023
01: 17: 49,430 -> 01: 17: 54,732
Excuse me, Emine ... Sire, again
He also promised me and then not ...

1024
01: 17: 54,733 -> 01: 17: 58,002
Mine as you know,
They are promises of sailor.

1025
01: 17: 59,070 -> 01: 18: 02,096
- It's true, I always believe him ...
- All right.

1026
01: 18: 02,206 -> 01: 18: 03,920
Sorry,
I will listen to some radio.

1027
01: 18: 04,700 -> 01: 18: 07,929
- Comrade Fantozzi!
- But, it's him!

1028
01: 18: 07,930 -> 01: 18: 12,178
The plutocratic demo forces,
with its unjust sanctions ...

1029
01: 18: 12,479 -> 01: 18: 13,122
"Cavalliere!"

1030
01: 18: 13,123 -> 01: 18: 15,937
They try to hinder
The return of the Empire.

1031
01: 18: 16,438 -> 01: 18: 18,238
Vote for DC, Fantozzi ...

1032
01: 18: 18,904 -> 01: 18: 20,404
Vote for me, Fantozzi!

1033
01: 18: 20,605 -> 01: 18: 22,105

The shield of the cross, Fantozzi.

1035

Vote for Falcao.

1036
01: 18: 24,763 -> 01: 18: 25,906
The hammer and sickle!

1037
01: 18: 25,907 -> 01: 18: 28,158
- Vote for me!
- Ivy, Fantozzi!

1038
01: 18: 28,359 -> 01: 18: 30,542
- .!
- P.C., P.C.!

1039
01: 18: 30,543 -> 01: 18: 32,743

- P.R.I., P.R.I., P.R.I.!

1040
01: 18: 33,378 -> 01: 18: 34,658
Decide ...

1041
01: 18: 34,659 -> 01: 18: 36,159
<i> Little by little ... </i>

1042
01: 18: 36,441 -> 01: 18: 40,231
<i> among so many contradictions
and jarring bells, </i>

1043
01: 18: 40,615 -> 01: 18: 46,542
<i> Fantozzi drew up a
perspriceless political decision. </i>

1044
01: 18: 47,666 -> 01: 18: 49,406
- Good Morning.

1045
01: 18: 49,950 -> 01: 18: 52,450
Here you go,
the electoral certificates ...

1046
01: 18: 52,451 -> 01: 18: 54,851
Sorry. Give me the ...

1047
01: 18: 55,307 -> 01: 18: 56,331
Taking.

1048
01: 18: 56,332 -> 01: 18: 57,832
The driving license ...

1049
01: 18: 58,979 -> 01: 19: 01,130
- Fantozzi.
- Fantocci.

1050
01: 19: 03,397 -> 01: 19: 05,497
- Cabin one.
- Cab number one?

1051
01: 19: 06,628 -> 01: 19: 08,128
- Cabin two.
- Thank you.

1052
01: 19: 09,373 -> 01: 19: 11,011
- Cabin three.
- Thank you.

1053
01: 19: 11,512 -> 01: 19: 12,652
Go, go vote ...

1054
01: 19: 12,653 -> 01: 19: 14,153
I go to one.

1055
01: 19: 15,893 -> 01: 19: 17,393
I go to one.

1056
01: 19: 24,255 -> 01: 19: 25,755
Please.

1057
01: 19: 27,532 -> 01: 19: 29,032
Have.

1058
01: 19: 29,392 -> 01: 19: 30,446
Thank you.

1059
01: 19: 30,447 -> 01: 19: 32,884
- Thank you.
- You can sit down.

1060
01: 19: 34,164 -> 01: 19: 35,664
You have voted Fantocci.

1061
01: 19: 41,500 -> 01: 19: 43,000
But...

1062
01: 19: 54,098 -> 01: 19: 55,598
- Would you let me?
- Ahead.

1063
01: 19: 59,877 -> 01: 20: 01,377
Occupied.

1064
01: 20: 05,189 -> 01: 20: 06,689
But what is he doing?

1065
01: 20: 06,765 -> 01: 20: 09,230
- I am voting!
- It's okay.

1066
01: 20: 15,273 -> 01: 20: 18,911
<i> Finally
with the heats of the new summer, </i>

1067
01: 20: 19,212 -> 01: 20: 24,485
<i> even for Fantozzi,
a day of peace and tranquility arrived. </i>

1068
01: 20: 28,290 -> 01: 20: 30,803
<i> A series of forest fires
It's devastating Italy. </i>

1069
01: 20: 31,104 -> 01: 20: 34,150
<i> The rangers
with the help of helicopters ... </i>

1070
01: 20: 34,179 -> 01: 20: 34,887
Is it hot?

1071
01: 20: 34,888 -> 01: 20: 37,431
<i> They are spraying tons
of water over the flames. </i>
